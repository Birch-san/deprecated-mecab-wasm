# Mecab in WebAssembly

[fasiha's `Mecab-Emscripten`](https://github.com/fasiha/mecab-emscripten) demonstrated that Mecab can be run in JS.

Let's see how far we get trying to compile to WebAssembly!

## Why

Mecab is an awesome C++ library and CLI for tokenizing Japanese characters.

Some pretty cool browser extensions could be built if MeCab were trivially embeddable into a webpage, at native speeds.

## Plan

[Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) provides a path:

> C/C++ Source ⇒ WebAssembly LLVM backend ⇒ s2wasm ⇒ WebAssembly

I assert that [fasiha's `Mecab-Emscripten`](https://github.com/fasiha/mecab-emscripten) did something very similar:

> C/C++ Source ⇒ LLVM bitcode ⇒ asm.js

We just need to take a slightly different direction.

### Plan B

If LLVM's WebAssembly backend is not ready, then we can take a more scenic route:

> C/C++ Source ⇒ LLVM bitcode ⇒ asm.js ⇒ asm2wasm

This seems like a wasted step though.
